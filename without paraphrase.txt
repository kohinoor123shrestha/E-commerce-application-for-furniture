I believe the Spotlight Club is unique compared to other clubs. It not only helps members improve their public speaking and camera-facing skills but also offers opportunities to learn about managing tasks, editing, and everything needed for the production of a show. I envision the Spotlight Club not only as a source of fun and engagement but also as a platform for personal growth and building confidence. My goal is to reintroduce innovative and lighthearted events that encourage the participation of everyone, ensuring that all members benefit from and contribute to the club. The activities I organize are designed to be enjoyable and memorable, allowing participants to look back on their experiences fondly. These activities will also enhance their interaction skills and general knowledge.


My experience as the Vice President of the Social Service Club has equipped me with valuable skills in communication and understanding of the dynamics related to club management. I think this experience has prepared me well to lead the Spotlight Club . My commitment to inclusivity and personal growth aligns perfectly with the club's goals of building confidence and providing memorable experiences through engaging activities. I am dedicated to expanding the club's reach, ensuring that everyone feels valued and encouraged to participate. With a vision for innovative and enjoyable events, I believe I can effectively guide the club towards further growth and success.


If elected as the president of the Spotlight Club, I am committed to ensuring that me as well as my every member grows in various aspects that will benefit them in the future. I aim to create an environment where even those who are hesitant or shy to participate in activities can gain confidence. By fostering bonds and enriching college life experiences, I envision the club becoming a cherished medium for members to look back on with happiness.

In summary, my vision for the Spotlight Club, combined with my dedication to inclusivity and personal growth and introduction to fun and knowledgebale events makes me the ideal candidate to lead the club.
